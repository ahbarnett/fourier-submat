# fourier-submat
MATLAB codes to generate the figures in the paper on Fourier submatrix condition number.

Alex Barnett, March-April 2020.

Prerequisites: MATLAB, any version R2017a or newer.

Setup: open MATLAB from this directory and run `addpath utils`

From MATLAB, the paper figures are then generated by running the following codes:

Fig.1: `fig_nearsymm.m` (this takes around 1 sec to run)  
Fig.3: `fig_dkb.m` (takes <1 sec to run)  
Fig.4: `fig_rates.m` (takes 30 sec to run, and uses `dftmeasrate.m`)  

There are also several mathematics/analysis checking codes in `theorytests`.

`utils` contains several helper routines, including some standard MATLAB codes by third parties.
